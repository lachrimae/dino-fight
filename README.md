# Dino fight
This was a prototype of a 2D game, in which the player (represented by a dinosaur) would try to bonk AI dinosaurs before those dinosaurs could bonk the player.

While the project still builds on my laptop, it now crashes at startup time because one of the libraries (Amethyst) on which the project depended is no longer maintained.

Here is what the dino sprites looked like:
